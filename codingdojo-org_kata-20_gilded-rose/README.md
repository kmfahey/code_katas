> 
> #### About this Kata
> 
> A refactoring Kata, bases on existing code.
> 
> #### Problem Description
> 
> Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a
> prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison.
> We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are
> constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have
> a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a
> no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task
> is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new
> category of items. First an introduction to our system:
> 
> * All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to
>   sell the item
> * All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
> * At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
