> Perhaps there’s more to the humble list of values than you might think.
> Let’s experiment with some basic list processing.
>
> Lists are one of the first data structures we learn as programmers. But
> familiarity doesn’t mean that we can’t learn a little from them.
>
> For this kata we’re going to code up three implementations of a list that
> has the following basic interface:
> 
> * The list consists of nodes. Each node has a string value, along with
>   whatever housekeeping the list itself needs.
> * New nodes are added to the end of the list.
> * You can ask the list if it contains a given string. If it does, it returns
>   the node containing that string.
> * You can delete a node from the list.
> * You can ask the list to return an array of all its values.
