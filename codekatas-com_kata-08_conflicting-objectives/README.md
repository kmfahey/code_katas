## Kata Instructions Excerpt

> Why do we write code? At one level, we’re trying to solve some particular
> problem, to add some kind of value to the world. But often there are also
> secondary objectives: the code has to solve the problem, and it also has to be
> fast, or easy to maintain, or extend, or whatever. So let’s look at that.
>
> For this kata, we’re going to write a program to solve a simple problem, and
> we’re going to write it with three different sub-objectives. Our program is
> going do process the dictionary we used in previous kata, this time looking
> for all six letter words which are composed of two concatenated smaller words.
> For example:
> 
> > al + bums => albums<br>
> > bar + ely => barely<br>
> > be + foul => befoul<br>
> > con + vex => convex<br>
> > here + by => hereby<br>
> > jig + saw => jigsaw<br>
> > tail + or => tailor<br>
> > we + aver => weaver
