# Q & A
# 
# To what extent did the design decisions you made when writing the original
# programs make it easier or harder to factor out common code?
#
# Having already written an extraction regex in both cases was helpful. But
# process_fh() is de novo code, it's a complete rewrite. The common code of the
# previous scripts was too messy to simply extract.
#
#
# Was the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?
#
# Yes. I used the first program's code as a starting point for writing the
# second.
#
#
# Is factoring out as much common code as possible always a good thing? Did the
# readability of the programs suffer because of this requirement? How about the
# maintainability?
#
# Looking back on the higher-order functions I wrote for my 3rd term project
# of my coding bootcamp, I'd say definitely not. Those were unmaintainable
# gibberish. In *this* case I don't think the readability or maintainability
# suffered.
