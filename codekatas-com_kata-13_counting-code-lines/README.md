> Counting lines of code in Java source is not quite as simple as it seems.
>
> This week letâ€™s write something vaguely useful: a utility that counts the
> number of lines of actual code in a Java source file. For the purpose of this
> exercise, a line is counted if it contains something other than whitespace or
> text in a comment.
