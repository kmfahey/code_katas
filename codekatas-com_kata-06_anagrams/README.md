## Kata Instructions Excerpt

> Back to non-realistic coding this week (sorry, Martin). Let’s solve some
> crossword puzzle clues.
>
> In England, I used to waste hour upon hour doing newspaper crosswords. As
> crossword fans will know, English cryptic crosswords have a totally different
> feel to their American counterparts: most clues involve punning or word play,
> and there are lots of anagrams to work through. For example, a recent Guardian
> crossword had:
> 
> > Down:<br/>
> > ..<br/>
> > 21. Most unusual form of arrest (6)<br/>
> 
> The hint is the phrase ‘form of,’ indicating that we’re looking for an
> anagram. Sure enough ‘arrest’ has six letters, and can be arranged nicely
> into ‘rarest,’ meaning ‘most unusual.’ (Other anagrams include raster,
> raters, Sartre, and starer)
> 
> A while back we had a thread on the Ruby mailing list about finding anagrams,
> and I’d like to resurrect it here. The challenge is fairly simple: given a
> file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of words
> that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the
> input that are anagrams of each other. For example, your program might include
> in its output:
> 
> > kinship pinkish<br/>
> > enlist inlets listen silent<br/>
> > boaster boaters borates<br/>
> > fresher refresh<br/>
> > sinks skins<br/>
> > knits stink<br/>
> > rots sort<br/>
> 
> If you run this on the word list here you should find 20683 sets of anagrams
> (a total of 48162 words), including all-time favorites such as
> 
> > crepitus cuprites pictures piecrust<br/>
> > paste pates peats septa spate tapes tepas<br/>
> > punctilio unpolitic<br/>
> > sunders undress<br/>
> 
> For added programming pleasure, find the longest words that are anagrams, and
> find the set of anagrams containing the most words (so “parsley players
> replays sparely” would not win, having only four words in the set).
