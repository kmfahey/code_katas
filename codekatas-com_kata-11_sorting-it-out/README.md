> Just because we need to sort something doesn’t necessarily mean we need to
> use a conventional sorting algorithm.
>
> We use sorting routines all the time; putting customer records in to name
> order, arranging orders by value (and even sorting the letters in a word
> back in KataSix). Most of the time we (wisely) use one of the sort routines
> built in to our language’s library (such as C’s qsort and Java’s
> java.Collections.sort). After all, very clever folks spent a lot of time
> getting these library routines tuned for speed and/or memory usage.
>
> However, there are times when whipping up a sort of our own can outperform
> these generic routines. Our challenge this week is to implement a couple of
> different sorts. (However, at the risk of giving the game away, these sorts
> both have something in common).
