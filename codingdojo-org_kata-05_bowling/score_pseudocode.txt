Score logic, preserved for posterity:

if the frame is a strike
    then the base score is 10
    if it's the 10th frame, it'll have two bonus rolls.
        if they're both strikes
            add 20
        else
            add the 2nd and 3rd bonus roll scores
    elif it's the 9th frame
        if the 10th frame is a spare
            add 10
        else
            add the first 2 scores from the 10th frame
    else
        if the next frame was a strike
            if the next next frame was a strike
                then add 20
            else
                then add 10 plus the next next frame's 1st score
        elif the next frame was a spare
            then add 10
        else
            then it adds on the next frame's two scores
elif the frame is a spare
    then the base score is 10
    if it's the 10th frame
        it'll have one bonus roll; add the score from the bonus roll
    else
        add the next frame's 1st roll
else
    the frame is open; the score is the 1st roll plus the 2nd roll
