> This description is based on that at [Adventures in C#: The Bowling Game
> Problem Description](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/acsbowling/)
> 
> Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of
> American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game. Here are some
> things that the program will not do:
> 
> * We will not check for valid rolls.
> * We will not check for correct number of rolls and frames.
> * We will not provide scores for intermediate frames.
> 
> Depending on the application, this might or might not be a valid way to define
> a complete story, but we do it here for purposes of keeping the kata light. I
> think youâ€™ll see that improvements like those above would go in readily if
> they were needed for real.
