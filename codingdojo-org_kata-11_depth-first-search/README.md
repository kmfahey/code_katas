## Variations

The author decided against using the dfs algorithm to answer user-like questions in a dynamic fashion. The exercise
was taken as an opportunity to implement both iterative and recursive DFS algorithms, with fixtures to apply them to
adjacency list, edge list, adjacency matrix, incidence matrix and adjacent map graph data structures.
