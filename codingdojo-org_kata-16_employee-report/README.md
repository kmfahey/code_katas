> #### Problem Description
> 
> Youâ€™re building an employee management system of a local grocery store. The
> shop-owner wants to open the shop on Sunday and due to legal restrictions
> employees younger than 18 years are not allowed to work Sundays. The employee
> asks for a reporting feature so she can schedule work shifts. All employees
> are already stored somewhere and have the following properties:
> 
> 1. **name**: string (the name of the employee)
> 2. **age**: number (the age in years of the employee)
