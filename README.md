# The Code_katas Repository, a Cache of Code "Katas" as Worked Through by the Author

The author is working their way through several collections of code "katas", in
the spirit enounced by Dave Thomas of [codekata.com](https://codekata.com/):

> But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and
> over again, using feedback to get better every time. ... In software we do our
> practicing on the job, and thatâ€™s why we make mistakes on the job. We need
> to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession. We need practice
> sessions.

The results are stored here, under [the Unlicense](LICENSE), where they may be
useful to others who are taking on the same katas and would benefit from example
work completed by another.
