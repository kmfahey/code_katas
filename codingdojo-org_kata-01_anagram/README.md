## Kata Partial Instructions

> Most of us have had to parse command-line arguments from time to time. If we
> don’t have a convenient utility, then we simply walk the array of strings
> that is passed into the main function. There are several good utilities
> available from various sources, but they probably don’t do exactly what we
> want. So let’s write another one!
>
> The arguments passed to the program consist of flags and values. Flags should
> be one character, preceded by a minus sign. Each flag should have zero, or one
> value associated with it.
>
> You should write a parser for this kind of arguments. This parser takes a
> schema detailing what arguments the program expects. The schema specifies the
> number and types of flags and values the program expects.
