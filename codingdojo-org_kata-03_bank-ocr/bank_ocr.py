# User Story 1
#
# You work for a bank, which has recently purchased an ingenious machine to
# assist in reading letters and faxes sent in by branch offices. The machine
# scans the paper documents, and produces a file with a number of entries which
# each look like this:
# 
#     _  _     _  _  _  _  _
#   | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
#   ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|
# 
# Each entry is 4 lines long, and each line has 27 characters. The first 3 lines
# of each entry contain an account number written using pipes and underscores,
# and the fourth line is blank. Each account number should have 9 digits, all of
# which should be in the range 0-9. A normal file contains around 500 entries.
#
# Your first task is to write a program that can take this file and parse it
# into actual account numbers.

# User Story 2
# 
# Having done that, you quickly realize that the ingenious machine is not in
# fact infallible. Sometimes it goes wrong in its scanning. The next step
# therefore is to validate that the numbers you read are in fact valid account
# numbers. A valid account number has a valid checksum. This can be calculated
# as follows:
# 
# account number:  3  4  5  8  8  2  8  6  5
# position names:  d9 d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1
# 
# checksum calculation:
# (d1+2*d2+3*d3+...+9*d9) mod 11 = 0
# 
# So now you should also write some code that calculates the checksum for a
# given number, and identifies if it is a valid account number.

# User Story 3

# Your boss is keen to see your results. He asks you to write out a file of your
# findings, one for each input file, in this format:
# 
# 457508000
# 664371495 ERR
# 86110??36 ILL
# 
# ie the file has one account number per row. If some characters are illegible,
# they are replaced by a ?. In the case of a wrong checksum, or illegible
# number, this is noted in a second column indicating status.

# Extracts account numbers from text, then marks them if they contains a
# nonparsing number, or if they don't checksum, and returns marked-up output.

# User Story 4
# 
# It turns out that often when a number comes back as ERR or ILL it is because
# the scanner has failed to pick up on one pipe or underscore for one of the
# figures. For example
# 
#     _  _  _  _  _  _     _ 
# |_||_|| || ||_   |  |  ||_ 
#   | _||_||_||_|  |  |  | _|
# 
# The 9 could be an 8 if the scanner had missed one |. Or the 0 could be an
# 8. Or the 1 could be a 7. The 5 could be a 9 or 6. So your next task is to
# look at numbers that have come back as ERR or ILL, and try to guess what they
# should be, by adding or removing just one pipe or underscore. If there is
# only one possible number with a valid checksum, then use that. If there are
# several options, the status should be AMB. If you still canâ€™t work out what
# it should be, the status should be reported ILL.


# Extracts account numbers from text, then marks them if they contains a
# nonparsing number, or if they don't checksum, and returns marked-up output.
#
# Rewrite that un-refactors the code of text_to_numerals(). Tests each number
# and attempts to "repair" it, assuming a missed character. Outputs the repaired
# number if it's reachable, or marks it AMB if more than one number could
# satisfy the constraints. Otherwise applies the ILL flag if it still has an
# unparseable character, or the ERR flag if it doesn't checksum.
