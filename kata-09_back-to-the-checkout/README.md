## Kata Text Selection

> Back to the supermarket. This week, we’ll implement the code for a checkout
> system that handles pricing schemes such as “apples cost 50 cents, three
> apples cost $1.30.”
>
> Way back in KataOne we thought about how to model the various options for
> supermarket pricing. We looked at things such as “three for a dollar,”
> “$1.99 per pound,” and “buy two, get one free.”
>
> This week, let’s implement the code for a supermarket checkout that
> calculates the total price of a number of items. In a normal supermarket,
> things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store,
> we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods
> are priced individually. In addition, some items are multipriced: buy n of
> them, and they’ll cost you y cents. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50
> cents individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s
> and they’ll cost you $1.30.
