# Gutenberg.org Ebooks About Tom Swift

The texts in this directory are not identical to the versions that would be
found on [gutenberg.org](https://gutenberg.org/). They have had their front
matter and back matter stripped off. The introductory text has been removed.
Chapter headings have been removed. And, where it was used, intra-textual
dividers that took the form of "* * *" have been removed.

All of this was done to preprocess the ebooks such that they contained only
the text suitable for the Markov chain generator's textual import process. It
was done in this way because the books' formatting had no common form and the
process of stripping unneeded text could not feasibly be automated.

As such these texts are not suitable for distribution. If you
want a copy of one of these ebooks the same filename found on
[gutenberg.org](https://gutenberg.org/) would have the text you should download.
