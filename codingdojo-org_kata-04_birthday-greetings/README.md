## Kata Instructions Excerpts

> ### Birthday Greetings
> 
> As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to
> all the friends you have. But you have a lot of friends and a bit lazy, it may
> take some times to write all the notes by hand.
> 
> The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you.
> 
> Imagine you have a flat file with all your friends:
> 
> > last\_name, first\_name, date\_of\_birth, email<br/>
> > Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com<br/>
> > Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
> 
> And you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birth date:
> 
> > Subject: Happy birthday!
> > 
> > Happy birthday, dear &lt;first\_name&gt;!
> 
> How would this software look like ? Try to implement it so you can easily change :
> 
> * the way you retrieve the friends data (for instance, try switching to a SQLite Db)
> * the way you send the note : (for instance, imagine you want to send SMS instead of emails)
> 
> What kind of tests would you write ? Would you use Mocks ?
