# Birthday Greetings
# 
# As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to
# all the friends you have. But you have a lot of friends and a bit lazy, it may
# take some times to write all the notes by hand.
# 
# The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you.
# 
# Imagine you have a flat file with all your friends :
# 
# last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email
# Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com
# Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
# 
# And you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birth date :
# 
# Subject: Happy birthday!
# 
# Happy birthday, dear <first_name>!
# 
# How would this software look like? Try to implement it so you can easily change :
# 
# * the way you retrieve the friends data (for instance, try switching to a
#   SQLite Db)
# * the way you send the note (for instance, imagine you want to send SMS
#   instead of emails)
# 
# What kind of tests would you write? Would you use Mocks?
