# This objective function has been replaced with
# eight_queens_util.free_queens_kmf(), which in a parallel test of 10000 random
# position arrays, consistently returned a number of free queens that was less
# than or equal to free_queens_sgak()'s measurement, and never returned a value
# that was greater than free_queens_sgak()'s measurement. Between the two I
# think it's this function that has the bug.
