## Kata Instructions Excerpt

> Write a program that solves word-chain puzzles.
> 
> There’s a type of puzzle where the challenge is to build a chain of words,
> starting with one particular word and ending with another. Successive entries
> in the chain must all be real words, and each can differ from the previous
> word by just one letter. For example, you can get from “cat” to “dog”
> using the following chain.
> 
> > cat<br/>
> > cot<br/>
> > cog<br/>
> > dog
> 
> The objective of this kata is to write a program that accepts start and end
> words and, using words from the dictionary, builds a word chain between them.
