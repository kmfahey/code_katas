## Kata Instructions Excerpt

> ### About this Kata
>
> The purpose is to build a cellular automaton : [Langton
> Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).
>
> #### Rules
>
> Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily
> identify one square as the “ant”. The ant can travel in any of the four
> cardinal directions at each step it takes. The “ant” moves according to
> the rules below:
>
> * At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move
>   forward one unit
> * At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move
>   forward one unit
>
> Langton’s ant can also be described as a cellular automaton, where the grid
> is colored black or white and the “ant” square has one of eight different
> colors assigned to encode the combination of black/white state and the current
> direction of motion of the ant.
