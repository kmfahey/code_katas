## Kata Instructions Excerpt

> ### Hello
>
> #### About this Kata
>
> This is the famous "[[Hello
> World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program)]" program.
> Hello World is perhaps the first Kata – it predates even the term
> “kata”. But people have been doing Hello World as effectively
> a kata for over thirty years. The seminal book [[The C Programming
> Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_%28book%29)]
> has created the tradition of making it the first program in any new language,
> environment, or methodology. So it follows that the first kata should be Hello
> World.
>
> Good for teaching: Katas themselves,
> [TDD](https://codingdojo.org/TestDrivenDevelopment), MockObjects, ensuring the
> environment is set up correctly.
